Contributor: Anupriya – Team Member (Presentation & Documentation Lead)
My Contribution

For Milestone 1 of our project “Food Brand Understand Customer Trends”, I was responsible for preparing the PowerPoint presentation that introduced the project concept, its objectives, and the planned functionalities.

I also contributed to add the Project Overview and Future Enhancements sections for the repository to clearly communicate our project’s direction and scope.
